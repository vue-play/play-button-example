We build a `<my-button />` component at `./components/Button.vue` using Bootstrap, and we register [bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.github.io/docs) at [./play/index.js](./play/index.js), writing a few scenarios for it to demonstrate.

To preview it:

```bash
yarn install
yarn play
```

To build it for production:

```
yarn build:play
```
